	/**
 * makeGallery
 * - This method will:
 * 	- Create the HTML structures for each image in the gallery.
 *  - Use the image paths located in the `imageArray` parameter as sources for the background images
 *    in the `figure` elements which are created.
 *  - Attach a click handler to the `figure` elements which are created that will call the
 *    `displayImage` function.
 *  - Append the completed `figure` elements to the `section` with the id of `gallery`.
 * ** Specifications **
 * - Takes one parameter:
 *   - imageArray - which will be the `pictures` array that contains all of the image paths.
 * - Within the function:
 *   - Use a for loop to go through the image array
 *   - Within the loop:
 *     - Use jQuery to create the following HTML elements and store them in variables:
 * 	     - a `figure` element with the following attributes:
 *         - class - imageGallery col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4
 *           - note: the above are CSS and bootstrap classes for styling purposes
 *         - imgPath:
 * 		     - Assign this attribute the path in the array which matches the current index of the loop!
 * 		       - Note: This is a custom attribute you will create in order to store the image path
 *                     which is being used for the background image. You are doing this so when you
 *                     need to update the image in the modal, you can easily retrieve the image path!
 *         - Also, Give the `figure` element a background image:
 *           - Hint: the path for the background image should be the path in the image array
 *             which corresponds to the current index of the loop
 *           - Hint: the jQuery .css() method can be very helpful here!
 *       - a `figcaption` element with text in it:
 * 			 - the text should be the name of the image which is in the path, but only the image name.
 *             - Example image 'images/landscape-1.jpg'
 *             - Example Title 'landscape-1'
 *           - Hint: The .slice() and .indexOf() methods can be very useful
 *                   as you need to select and save only a part of the paths to get
 *                   title from the path
 *    - Append the `figure` and `figcaption` elements into the correct HTML structure
 *      - the `figcaption` is a child of the `figure`
 *    - Add a click handler to the `figure` element which calls the `displayImage` function on click.
 *    - Append the completed HTML structure to the `section` element with the id of `gallery`
 *
 * - Considerations
 *   - How do you use .css() to set the background image property for the `figure` element?
 *     - https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_css.asp
 *   - How do you use .slice() to select a piece of the path strings and store it to use as the
 *     `figcaption?
 *     - https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_slice_string.asp
 *   - How do you use indexOf to find where to use .slice()?

 * - Takes no parameters
 * ** Within the function **

/**
 * displayImage
 * - This method will:
 *   - Set the text of the modal to match the caption of the image which was clicked on
 *   - Set the `src` of the image tag to be the image path of the image that was clicked on
 *   - Use jQuery to select the div with the id of `galleryModal` and call the .modal() method
 *     with the proper argument to open the modal.
 * ** Specifications **
 * - Takes one parameter - event - which will be the event object which is passed in by jQuery as
 *   an argument when the `displayImage` function is called by the click handler.
 * ** Within the function**
 * - Use jQuery to select the `currentTarget` property on the `event` parameter and save it in a variable.
 *   - Note: The `currentTarget` property on the event object will contain a reference to the
 *           element which was clicked on. This will allow you to target the specific element
 *           which was clicked on so you can retrieve the data you need from it to populate the modal!
 * - Call the .attr() method on the variable which contains the jQuery reference to the element which was
 *   clicked on, and pass it a string as an argument which matches the name of the custom attribute you
 *   saved the image path to in the 'makeGallery' function.
 *   - Store what is returned in a variable named `imagePath`.
 * - Use the .slice() method on the imagePath variable you created in the previous step and select only the
 *   the name of the image (Ex. landscape-15).
 *   - Store this title string in variable named `imageTitle`
 * - Use jQuery to select the `h4` with the class of `modal-title` and update the text to match the
 *   string which is stored in the `imageTitle` variable.
 * - Use jQuery to select the `img` tag with the id of `modalImage` and set the `src` of the `img` tag to the
 *   to the path stored in the `imagePath` variable.
 * - Use jQuery to select the div with the id of `galleryModal` and call the .modal() method
 *   with the proper argument to open the modal.
 * **Considerations**
 * - How do you use the .attr() method to retrieve a value stored in an attribute?
